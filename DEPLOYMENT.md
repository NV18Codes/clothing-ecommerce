- [ ] Verify images and assets load
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness

### Build Commands:
```bash
# Install dependencies

   - Verify `BrowserRouter` is used
   - Check redirect configuration
   - Test all routes manually

### Build Debugging:
```bash
# Check build output
npm run build

# Test build locally
npx serve -s build -l 3000

# Check for errors
npm run build 2>&1 | tee build.log
```
