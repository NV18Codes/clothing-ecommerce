# 🔧 Build Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Invalid href Attributes
**Files:** `src/components/Footer.js`, `src/pages/Community.js`

**Problem:** Links with `href="#"` are not accessible and cause build warnings.

**Solution:** Replaced with proper external links:
```jsx
// Before
<a href="#" aria-label="Facebook">

// After  
<a href="https://facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Facebook">
```

### 2. Unused Variables
**Files:** `src/pages/Checkout.js`, `src/pages/ShopMen.js`, `src/pages/ShopWomen.js`

**Problem:** Variables imported but never used causing build warnings.

**Solution:** Removed unused imports:
```jsx
// Before
import { CreditCard, MapPin, User, Mail, Phone, Lock, ArrowLeft } from 'lucide-react';
const { addToCart, addToWishlist, selectedCategory, setCategory, ... } = useApp();

// After
import { CreditCard, MapPin, Lock, ArrowLeft } from 'lucide-react';
const { addToCart, addToWishlist, setCategory, ... } = useApp();
```
